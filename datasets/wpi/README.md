# OpenH-RF Sub-Dataset — Rotational 3D US Raw Channel Data for Elevational SAF (Simulated + Measured Phantom)

<p align="center"><img src="assets/main.png" width="55%" alt="Top-view MIP overlay: magenta is the naive no-SAF reconstruction's rotational-smear arc, cyan is this dataset's paired eSAF label, white/pale-blue is where both agree on the true target"></p>

**Main image (`assets/main.png`).** A top-view maximum-intensity-projection
through the target depth, looking straight down the rotation axis, of a single
target reconstructed two ways at once — encoded by color, not by side-by-side
panels, both on the same dB scale:
**magenta = naive** (one in-plane B-mode per rotation angle, gridded straight
into 3D by rotation angle, no SAF), **cyan = this dataset's paired eSAF label**
(`custom/saf_bmode`, already shipped in every file). Where the two agree —
the true target — the overlay goes white / pale blue. The long magenta arc is
exactly the rotational-smear artifact this dataset's Known Issues describe;
eSAF collapses it back onto the target.

Simulated `tall_elev_H12` probe, point target at **20 mm depth, 6 mm off the
rotation axis**
([`data/tall_elev_H12__point_z020_r6.hdf5`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/blob/main/wpi/data/tall_elev_H12__point_z020_r6.hdf5),
arc-FWHM 1.26 mm → 0.39 mm, ~3.2×, see that file's
`custom/saf_bmode/values.description`). The sim grid's depth axis is only
{20, 45, 80, 130} mm — there is no simulated 10 mm case (10 mm exists only
as a measured-phantom scan) — so this is the shallowest off-axis (r0 ≥ 4 mm)
simulated case available, chosen for the largest before→after gain among the
probe/radius combinations at that depth.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/esaf_topview_sweep.gif" width="55%" alt="Animated version: the naive magenta reconstruction accumulating into the smear arc as the probe sweeps its 180 degree rotation about the marked rotation axis"></p>

Same color coding, animated, with the geometry made explicit: the small
circle is the **rotation axis** (the probe's own axial axis, perpendicular to
the page), and the white line through it is the array's **current physical
orientation** as it sweeps 180°. The magenta (naive) side fills in one angle
at a time as the line sweeps — this is what accumulates if you *don't* run
eSAF on this data — while the cyan (eSAF) side is already fully known
throughout.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/esaf_topview_before_after.png" width="70%" alt="Annotated version of the same top-view MIP: mm axes, the rotation axis marked and its 180 degree sweep direction, a color legend, and the arc-FWHM numbers"></p>

The same overlay again, annotated for readers who want the scale bar, an
explicit color legend, and the rotation geometry spelled out rather than
left to the caption above.

Unrelated to the eSAF comparison above: `reconstruct.py`'s own reference
output — a single measured-phantom frame (frame 90, ~-90°) plus the per-frame
rotation-angle trajectory this dataset adds — checked in at `assets/bmode.png`.

## Dataset Description
Synthetic rotational 3D ultrasound acquisitions of point, pair, and off-axis targets, captured
with an **elevation-focused 1D linear array** that is rotated 180° about its axial
axis (1° steps, 180 frames). Each acquisition stores the **raw per-element channel
RF** for a single normal plane-wave transmit at every rotation angle — i.e. the data
*before* in-plane beamforming — which is what enables flexible offline beamforming and
the **elevational Synthetic Aperture Focusing (eSAF)** method. The targets span a wide
depth range to capture the depth-dependent elevational beam thickness (the artifact
eSAF corrects). The release is **mostly simulated (Field II)**, complemented by a
small set of **real measured phantom** rotational scans acquired with the physical
Japan Probe 68-element array (same geometry as the simulation) over a shallow-to-focal
depth series (10–45 mm). **Simulated + measured phantom** data (no in-vivo / subjects).

## Intended Usage
Advanced beamforming and **elevational resolution recovery** for rotational 3D US
(eSAF), elevation-PSF / aperture-growth studies, and as a reproducible raw-channel-data
benchmark for rotational synthetic-aperture reconstruction.

## Dataset Characterization
- **Data Collection Method:** synthetic, generated with **Field II** (Jensen) run in
  **MATLAB**. The main release is a **probe × target grid** produced by
  `sim/batch_sim_probe_target.m` (source) (with `sim/sim_probe_catalog.m` /
  `sim/sim_target_catalog.m`, source): for each (probe type, target) it uses `xdc_focused_array`
  + `calc_scat_multi` to produce the raw per-element channel RF at every rotation angle
  (scatterer rotated about the axial axis, transducer fixed), then `sim/sim_dataset_to_zea.py`
  (source) repackages every case into the zea format here. **10 probe types** span lateral aperture
  (`n_el` 32/68/128, pitch 0.1/0.2/0.3 mm), elevation height `H` (4/8/12 mm), and elevation
  focal depth `R` (25/45/90 mm + unfocused) — encoded directly in each probe's name
  (e.g. `tall_elev_H12` = `H` 12 mm; `baseline_R45_H8` = `R` 45 mm, `H` 8 mm) and in
  `probe/*` (geometry, element size) inside each `.hdf5`.
  (The earlier 18-acquisition set generated by `sim/batch_generate_fieldii.m` +
  `sim/mat_to_zea.py` (source) remains available as a compatible alternative with the
  identical schema.)
  **Measured phantom acquisitions (5):** real rotational scans of the physical Japan
  Probe 68-element array on a wire/point phantom, acquired with CPWC channel-RF capture
  (`experiment/Ryo_SetUp_JP68_PWCompound_3D_ChannelRF.m`, source) and a Galil-controlled 180°
  rotation. Each scan is time-tag-synced (frames → motor angles) and reduced to the
  **single centre (normal) plane wave per angle** by `experiment/sync_channel_rf.m` (source)
  (so the schema matches the simulation, n_tx = 1), then converted with the same
  `sim/sim_dataset_to_zea.py` (source). They span a shallow-to-focal depth series (10, 20, 30,
  40, 45 mm nominal target depth).
- **Labeling Method:** synthetic ground truth (exact target positions known; each
  file's top-level `description` attribute records the probe name and target
  name/depth/radius, e.g. `probe=tall_elev_H12 target=point_z020_r6 r0=6.0mm z=20.0mm`).
- **Acquisition system (simulated):** Japan Probe JP_Linear_68 — 68-element linear
  array, pitch 0.2 mm, element width 0.15 mm, element height 8 mm, **elevational lens
  focus 45 mm** (Field II `xdc_focused_array` with 500 elevation math sub-elements);
  center frequency 10 MHz; sampling 40 MHz (NS200BW, 4 samples/wavelength); speed of
  sound 1490 m/s; single normal plane-wave transmit per rotation angle; 180° rotation,
  1° step (180 frames). Parameters match the paper simulation.

## Dataset Format
zea file format (HDF5), one file per acquisition, **single track**: the raw
channel RF + scan parameters live in the standard data/scan groups
(`tracks/track_0` on disk), and the paired eSAF label volume is stored as a
**zea custom field** in the `custom` group (`custom/saf_bmode`, read via
`zea.File.custom` — see below). The fused SAF volume is a single frame, so it
cannot share the data group with the ~180-frame `raw_data` (zea validates
`n_frames` across all fields of a data group); the `custom` group is the zea
mechanism for exactly such data, and keeping the file single-track avoids the
`track_schedule` warning a multi-track file would print on every load.
Pre-processing — *simulated:* none
beyond the forward model (raw RF, not demodulated/decimated); *measured:* time-tag
frame→angle synchronisation, per-angle dwell averaging, and centre-plane-wave selection
(still raw per-element RF, not demodulated/decimated; `scan/demodulation_frequency`
records the 10 MHz demodulation applied by the reference pipeline). The probe
rotation per frame is stored as the zea **`metadata/probe_pose`** trajectory
(`rotation_representation="euler_xyz"`, **radians**; the array rotates about its
axial axis, so the angle is the z Euler component and the translation is zero).
Note `probe_pose/sampling_frequency = 1.0 Hz` is a **nominal** one-pose-per-frame
value, not a physical acquisition rate. Every file is
written with `zea.File.create()` (`sim/sim_dataset_to_zea.py` +
`sim/pack_saf_labels.py`, source) and carries a
`zea_version` stamp, so zea loads it natively (not as a legacy file).

**Paired pre-/post-SAF labels (the dataset's target output).** Each file also carries
the **elevational-SAF reconstructed 3D B-mode volume** as the custom field
**`custom/saf_bmode`**: `values` is `(1, z, x, y)` float32 in **dB** (log-compressed
normalized envelope, 0 dB = volume max, empty pixels −inf) and `coordinates` holds
the per-pixel `[x, y, z]` positions in **meters**, shape `(z, x, y, 3)`; both carry
`description`/`unit` attributes. This is
the *post*-SAF **output/label** paired with the *pre*-beamformed **input**
(`data/raw_data`):
the raw channel RF is back-projected through the published eSAF algorithm
(`matlab/saf/safrot_backproj.m`, source: in-plane DAS → `recon_3d` → `safrot_backproj`,
elevational focus 45 mm, f-number 45/8) into a 3D volume `B_SAF(x,y,z)`, generated by
`sim/make_saf_all.m` → `experiment/run_esaf_synced.m` (source) and written into the zea
file by `sim/pack_saf_labels.py` (source). The stored volume covers
a thin depth window (±2 mm) about the target; per-case arc-FWHM before/after and gain
are in the `description` attribute of `custom/saf_bmode/values` (e.g. `... arc FWHM
before/after = 1.255/0.393 mm`). Read it with `zea.File`:

```python
with zea.File("data/baseline_R45_H8__point_z080_r4.hdf5") as f:
    saf = {e.name: e for e in f.custom}  # custom/saf_bmode elements
    volume_db = saf["values"].data  # (1, z, x, y) float32 dB
    coordinates = saf["coordinates"].data  # (z, x, y, 3) float32 m
    print(saf["values"].description)  # axes + eSAF parameters + arc-FWHM
```

A **MATLAB `.mat` version** of the same raw channel data + metadata, plus a
**reference eSAF-beamformed** result and a `_ref.png` figure, is provided **per
acquisition** alongside the source grid as `sim_dataset_out/<probe>/<target>.mat`
and `..._ref.png` (each `.mat` holds the raw RF, the in-plane DAS, the metadata and
the eSAF output produced with the published algorithm `matlab/saf/safrot_backproj.m`
(source): in-plane DAS → `recon_3d` → `safrot_backproj`, f-number 45/8). A FWHM-vs-depth
overview across probes is `sim_dataset_out/dataset_overview_r4.png`
(`sim/dataset_overview.m`, source). The zea `.hdf5` acquisitions are **hosted on Hugging
Face** at <https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/tree/main/wpi> (git-LFS,
part of the unified OpenH-RF dataset repo). The MATLAB `.mat`/`_ref.png` intermediates are
reproducible from source and kept on lab storage.

## Dataset Quantification

**Current OpenH-RF release:** 195 HDF5 files; 1.87 GB (1,870,462,976 bytes) stored; root `zea_version` **0.1.6**. Sizes include all HDF5 contents and use decimal units (MB = 10^6 bytes, GB = 10^9 bytes, TB = 10^12 bytes), not decoded-array memory or original-source download sizes.

- **Acquisitions:** **195** = **190 simulated** + **5 measured phantom**.
  - *Simulated (190):* **10 probe types × 19 targets** (16 single points over depth
    {20,45,80,130} mm × radial offset from the rotation centre {0,2,4,6} mm, plus 3
    pair/oblique cases). The probe axis is listed above under Data Collection Method;
    each file's own `description` attribute gives its exact probe/target/r0/depth. (The
    earlier compatible set has 18 acquisitions.)
  - *Measured (5):* real rotational phantom scans at nominal depths {10,20,30,40,45} mm
    (`experiment__acq_exp_*.hdf5`), centre plane wave, ~182 measured rotation angles
    over ~180°.
- **Frames per acquisition:** simulated 180 (one per 1° step); measured ~182 (the
  actual encoder angles are stored in `metadata/probe_pose` — z Euler component,
  radians — not necessarily uniform).
- **Stored HDF5 size:** 1.87 GB (1,870,462,976 bytes), including the paired `saf_bmode` label volumes.
- **Train/val/test split:** N/A (benchmark / characterization set; the probe × depth ×
  radius axes are the intended study dimensions).

### Per-sample feature table
Shapes use placeholders because dimensions vary across the probe grid and between
simulated and measured scans: **`n_frames`** = 180 (simulated, one per 1° step) or
~182 (measured encoder angles); **`n_el`** ∈ {32, 68, 128} (probe grid; 68 for the
baseline and all measured scans); **`n_ax`** = axial sample count (per case);
**`n_z`** = depth samples of the label volume (target ± ~2 mm window).

Paths below are inside each `.hdf5`; with `zea.File` use `f.data` / `f.scan` /
`f.metadata.probe_pose`, and `f.custom` for the SAF label volume.

## Subject Metadata
No human or animal subjects / no PHI. Each file stores `metadata/subject/type`:
`simulated phantom` for the Field II simulations, `phantom` for the measured
`experiment__*` scans. Creator attribution is stored per file in `metadata/credit`.

## Data Validation
`reconstruct.py` (**runnable, verified** — official `zea` API, no fallback code)
loads one zea acquisition, reads its acquisition parameters via
`zea.Config.from_path('pipeline.yaml')` + `File.load_parameters`, beamforms the
rotation frame closest to ±90° rotation magnitude (the frame where an off-axis target
lies in-plane; this handles signed encoder angles too — measured scans run 0 → ~−180°)
with the native `zea.Pipeline` op chain **Cast → Demodulate → Beamform(delay_and_sum) →
EnvelopeDetect → Normalize → LogCompress** defined in `pipeline.yaml`, and writes a
two-panel PNG: the B-mode image, and the per-frame probe **rotation angle**
(from `metadata/probe_pose`, plotted in degrees) so downstream users know how to
interpret the frame axis — the special data this dataset adds:
```
python reconstruct.py
```
(the script takes no CLI arguments; edit the `INPUT`/`OUTPUT`/`FRAME_INDEX` constants
at the top of the file to point at a different acquisition or frame). Reference output:
`assets/bmode.png` — frame 90 (~-90° rotation) of `data/experiment__acq_exp_30mm.hdf5`,
shown above. The rotational **eSAF** across frames — the contribution of this dataset — is implemented in
`matlab/saf` (source) (`recon_3d` → `safrot_backproj`); per-probe before/after eSAF reference
images and a FWHM-vs-depth overview accompany the MATLAB `.mat` release
(`sim/dataset_overview.m`, source), and the resulting paired SAF volume is stored as
the `custom/saf_bmode` custom field of every `.hdf5` (see Dataset Format above).

## Known Issues
- **Paired SAF label — on-axis targets (r0 = 0) do not narrow, by design.** eSAF
  refocuses the *rotational elevation smear*; a target sitting on the rotation axis has
  essentially no smear, so its `saf_bmode` label volume is not sharper than the input (arc-FWHM
  gain ≈ 1). This is expected physics, not a defect — the 40 on-axis cases (median gain
  1.00×) are included so the pair covers the degenerate no-smear case. Off-axis targets
  (n=120, median gain 1.75×, up to ~12×) and paired/oblique targets (n=30, median 3.71×)
  improve clearly; targets at the focal depth (~45 mm) and weak-elevation-focus probes
  (`efocus_deep_90`, `elev_unfocused`) have less smear to recover. Across all 195 cases,
  median arc-FWHM gain is 1.36× (42 cases < 1×, mostly the on-axis/near-focus group above).
  Arc-FWHM is measured on a **centred** reconstruction: the smear circle passes through both
  the rotation axis and the target (not a circle centred on the rotation axis). The eSAF
  back-projection uses a fixed elevational focus of 45 mm; per-depth focus tuning (see
  `docs/eSAF_focus_depth_study_JP.md`, source) can further sharpen deep off-axis cases but was
  not applied here (single as-designed focus).
- **Measured phantom depth window.** The real reflector bead sits **~4 mm off the rotation
  axis** (not on-axis) and, for each scan, slightly deeper than the folder's nominal depth
  label; labels are reconstructed over the interactively-identified reflector depth window
  (not a naive nominal-depth ± 2 mm window), which matters because a mis-centred window can
  pick up near-axis clutter instead of the actual bead.
- **Simulated** data (Field II spatial-impulse-response model): realistic transducer
  field, but no tissue attenuation, aberration, multiple scattering, or electronic
  noise. Not a substitute for measured data.
- Speed of sound is 1490 m/s, matching the paper Table 1 and the experiment.
- A single normal plane-wave transmit per rotation angle is simulated (the dataset
  stores n_tx = 1); multi-angle compounding is left to downstream users.
- **Measured scans:** acquired as 7-angle CPWC; only the **centre (0°) plane wave** is
  kept here to match the n_tx = 1 schema. The dwell frames per angle are averaged before
  storage (noise reduction). Real reflectors are not ideal point scatterers — expect
  reverberation/clutter near the surface and specular layering; rotation angles are the
  measured encoder values (slightly non-uniform, full span ≈ 180°, sign per encoder
  direction). The elevational lens focus is the nominal 45 mm, but the effective
  back-projection focus for eSAF is depth-dependent on real data (see
  `docs/eSAF_focus_depth_study_JP.md`, source).

## Raw Source Data
The raw, pre-conversion acquisition/simulation outputs that were processed into the
zea `.hdf5` files above are archived (same CC BY 4.0 license) at
<https://huggingface.co/datasets/RyoMurakami/OpenH-RF-eSAF-raw>: the raw Verasonics
per-line channel-RF captures (`RFdata_line*.mat` + encoder logs) for the 5 measured
acquisitions, and the per-case MATLAB intermediates (raw RF, in-plane DAS, eSAF
output) for the 190 simulated cases. See that repository's README for how each
maps to `data/*.hdf5` here.

## Ethical Considerations
None. The data is either fully synthetic (Field II) or measured on an **inanimate
phantom** — no human or animal subjects, no PHI, no consent/IRB constraints.
